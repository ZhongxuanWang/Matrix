# Matrix - python

**An unscientific matrix manipulation class written in python**


<hr>
update:
remove matplot (totally useless)
remove dependency on numpy notes: this is because this class is just for unscientific use, and there's no need to use numpy to improve the negligible speed in order to install a huge package.
remove rand and randint function temporarily for removing the support of numpy
add argmax / argmin

code update:
add a duplicate array with mat


bug fix:
fix a bug that would result in the modification of original attribute
